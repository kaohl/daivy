## Build from source

NOTE
xerces depends on "xml-commons-external" and "xml-commons-resolver"
See build/xerces.../{build.xml,tools/}

Tried to find source code for these so we can add to framework.

Only the SVN repo seems to have tags for different
versions of xml-commons-external and xml-commons-resolver...
