Multi-Release not supported in frameworks
- The build and refactoring frameworks does not currently handle
  Multi-Release projects so we can only build lucene modules for jdk11 and,
  I'm guessing, up to and including jdk17, because lucene-core has source
  additions for higher versions of the jdk.
