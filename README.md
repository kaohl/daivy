# daivy
A Java build framework supporting source and binary transformations of projects and dependencies
WARNING: Do not distribute artifacts compiled or generated by the current version of this framework.
Artifacts may be incomplete.

# Build and run benchmark
Build dependencies and benchmark using 'build.py', then
run the jar deployed in 'context'.
```
./build.py --project dacapo:batik:1.0 --context context --clean --verbose
java -jar context/batik-1.0.jar
```

# Troubleshooting
## Classpath issues (relative paths in Class-Path attribute)
When using relative paths in the manifest Class-Path attribute, paths are
interpreted relative the directory in which the executed jar resides.
All resources required by a benchmark is deployed in the build context with
a working manifest classpath to deployed artifacts copied from the ivy cache.
Check the Class-Path attribute in the built benchmark jar and also resources
in dependencies if classes appears to be missing.

Absolute paths can be used in the Class-Path attribute since we are not
distributing built artifacts, but should be avoided. Add additional jars
to the build context deployment with relative paths in Class-Path instead.
